Hi I'm Thomas Finch, I'm currently a student at the University of Michigan studying computer science. 

I like to develop software in my free time, I've built some tweaks for jailbroken iOS devices before and have had a ton of fun with it. I also enjoy reverse engineering, especially on iOS. 

In summer 2015 I interned as a software engineer at [Arbor Networks](http://www.arbornetworks.com/) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In summer 2016 I interned at Apple in the information security department.

Feel free to contact me through email or Twitter, I'd love to talk.
