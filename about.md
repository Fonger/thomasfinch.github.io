Hi I'm Thomas Finch, I'm currently a student at the University of Michigan studying computer science. 

I like to develop software in my free time, I've built some tweaks for jailbroken iOS devices before and have had a ton of fun with it. I'm currently working on a few iOS apps which should be coming out sometime in the near future. I also enjoy reverse engineering, especially on iOS. 

This summer I'm interning as a software engineer at [Arbor Networks](http://www.arbornetworks.com/) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

Feel free to contact me through email or Twitter, I'd love to talk.
