	<p class='about-paragraph'>Hi, I'm Thomas. I'm currently a student at the University of Michigan studying computer science, and I also like to develop software in my free time. I've built some tweaks for jailbroken iOS devices before, and have had a ton of fun with it. I'm currently working on a few iOS apps which should be coming out sometime in the near future. Feel free to contact me through email or Twitter, I'd love to talk.</p>
