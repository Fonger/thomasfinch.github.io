	<p class='about-paragraph'>Hi, I'm Thomas. I'm currently a student at the University of Michigan studying computer science, and I also like to develop software in my free time. Recently I've been building tweaks for jailbroken iOS devices, and have had a ton of fun with it. Feel free to contact me through email or Twitter, I'd love to talk.</p>
