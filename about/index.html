	<p class='about-paragraph'>My name is Thomas Finch, and I'm currently a student at the University of Michigan studying computer science. <br /><br /> I also like to develop software in my free time, I've built some tweaks for jailbroken iOS devices before and have had a ton of fun with it. I'm currently working on a few iOS apps which should be coming out sometime in the near future. I also enjoy reverse engineering, especially on iOS. <br /><br /> Feel free to contact me through email or Twitter, I'd love to talk.</p>
